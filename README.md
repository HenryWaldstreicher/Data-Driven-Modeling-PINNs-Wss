Ensure your environment is correctly set up

in conda, before you do your installations type:
conda env --name myenv

It should automatically activate, but if not type:
conda activate myenv

Next paste in the commands in one of the first 4 cells into the terminal to install torch, torchaudio, and torchvision
Then you can run all cells in the notebook
